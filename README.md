## Releases

There are no releases yet, nor do I know when there will be as I've got a lot going on and am trying to find the time to code it.
I tend to do little bits here and there, so even though it looks like a lot of commits, there is not much changed. I am just chronically scared of losing my work.

## Notes

Feel free to send me an issue for any ideas that you may have.
